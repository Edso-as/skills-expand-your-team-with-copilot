# Guide for Teachers: How to Request Changes

Welcome! This guide explains how to request changes to the Mergington High School Activities system without needing to modify code directly.

## Overview

We've created easy-to-use forms (issue templates) that help you clearly describe what you need. These forms ensure that all the necessary information is included so that changes can be implemented quickly and accurately.

## Available Request Types

### 1. Add New Activity
**When to use:** You want to add a new extracurricular activity to the system.

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Activity name (e.g., "Robotics Club", "Book Club")
- Description of the activity
- Meeting schedule (days and times)
- Maximum number of participants
- Any additional information (prerequisites, materials needed, etc.)

**How to submit:** Go to [Issues](../../issues/new/choose) and select "Add New Activity"

---

### 2. Modify Existing Activity
**When to use:** You need to change information about an activity that already exists.

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Which activity to modify
- What needs to be changed (name, description, schedule, max participants)
- Exactly what the new values should be
- Reason for the change (optional but helpful)

**How to submit:** Go to [Issues](../../issues/new/choose) and select "Modify Existing Activity"

---

### 3. Bug Report
**When to use:** Something isn't working correctly on the website.

**What you'll need to provide:**
- What's not working
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem
- What should happen vs. what actually happens
- How often it occurs
- Any error messages or screenshots

**How to submit:** Go to [Issues](../../issues/new/choose) and select "Bug Report"

---

### 4. UI or Design Change
**When to use:** You want to change how the website looks or how users interact with it.

**What you'll need to provide:**
- Which part of the website needs changes
- What it looks like now
- What you'd like it to look like
- Why the change is needed
- Any design preferences (colors, layout, etc.)

**How to submit:** Go to [Issues](../../issues/new/choose) and select "UI or Design Change"

---

### 5. Feature Request
**When to use:** You have an idea for a new feature that doesn't fit the other categories.

**What you'll need to provide:**
- The problem or need this feature addresses
- Your proposed solution
- Who will use the feature
- How important the feature is
- Any alternative solutions you've considered

**How to submit:** Go to [Issues](../../issues/new/choose) and select "Feature Request"

---

## How to Submit a Request

1. **Go to the Issues page:** Click [here](../../issues/new/choose) or navigate to the "Issues" tab in the repository.

2. **Choose the appropriate template:** Select the template that best matches your request.

3. **Fill out the form:** Provide all required information. The more details you provide, the easier it will be to implement your request.

4. **Submit the issue:** Click "Submit new issue" when you're done.

5. **Track progress:** You'll receive notifications about your request. You can also check the issue page to see updates.

## Tips for Successful Requests

✅ **Be specific:** Instead of "change the schedule," write "change Chess Club schedule from Mondays 3-4 PM to Wednesdays 3-4 PM"

✅ **Include examples:** Provide concrete examples of what you want, especially for UI changes

✅ **Explain why:** Context helps implementers understand the goal and make better decisions

✅ **Check for duplicates:** Before creating a new issue, check if someone else has already requested the same thing

❌ **Don't skip required fields:** All required fields are marked with an asterisk (*). They're necessary for implementation.

❌ **Don't combine multiple unrelated requests:** Create separate issues for different changes so they can be tracked independently

## What Happens Next?

1. **Review:** Your request will be reviewed to ensure all necessary information is provided
2. **Assignment:** The issue will be assigned to someone (possibly GitHub Copilot!) to implement
3. **Implementation:** Changes will be made according to your specifications
4. **Testing:** Changes will be tested to ensure they work correctly
5. **Completion:** You'll be notified when the changes are live
